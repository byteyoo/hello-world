## Inspiration
An important learning experience in this senior undergrad-level course is having the opportunity to delve deeper into the topic of Systems Design and Analysis.  One of the best ways to build a greater understanding of a topic is to teach it to others. This assignment combines these two elements of learning: you will develop expertise in a topic, present the material to the class, and lead the class discussion to establish their understanding.
